# Feature_selection_RandomForest

Feature selection is an one of important techniques to tackle curse of dimensionality. High dimension can cause the training of the classifers slow, moreover, data in high dimensional space may contain noise. Hence, selecting a subset of the important features may make the models perform faster and even better sometimes.
